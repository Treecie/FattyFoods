# FattyFoods




## Presentation

Elevator pitch: This app is designed to be able to order and have keto foods delivered. 

Concept: Dieting is already hard enough. When you follow a diet as specific as keto, finding quick eats can be very difficult. Having 
a app that delivers and has specific options and provides net carbs makes it easier to stay on track. 

Process: React, Node, Heroku, Mongo etc. How did you break down and assign tasks and roles? This was a solo project. 
What challenges did you encounter? I was unable to get the app to load more than a blank page. What were your successes? I was able to solve every error received. 

Directions for future development: It would great if this app supported more than one kind of diet...Vegan and Paleo come to mind.
